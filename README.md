# GameHub — Styled (Bootstrap)

This project is an enhanced version of Assignment 1, updated to use Bootstrap components and responsive layout.

What's included:
- `index.html`, `about.html`, `news.html`, `reviews.html` — updated to use Bootstrap navbar, containers and components.
- `styles.css` — project-specific styles (scoped to avoid overriding Bootstrap defaults).
- `assets/wireframe.svg` — simple wireframe image for the project.
- `assets/self-study.md` — notes on Bootstrap components explored (Carousel, Accordion).

How to run: open any `*.html` in your browser or serve the folder with a static server.
