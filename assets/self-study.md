# Self-study: Bootstrap components explored

I reviewed the Bootstrap Components documentation and used two components not covered in lectures:

1. Carousel (Slides) — used on `index.html` as the featured games carousel to showcase images with controls.
2. Cards — used on `news.html` and `index.html` to present content in responsive visual cards.

Notes:
- Carousel: configured with controls; images are responsive using Bootstrap utility classes and a polished container.
- Cards: used a responsive grid of cards for news and featured picks; cards include images, headings, dates, and CTAs.
